# VPN plugin for Adblock.

## Reason for development:
Due to the particularity of VPN services, we have open sourced the VPN module, you can check the source code to make sure we don't do anything dangerous.

This plugin is open source, safe, and only for blocking ads.

## How to use.
This application is only used as a plug-in of Adblock. Whether the specific advertisement is blocked is judged in Adblock. It will only send an ambiguous URL to Adblock to determine whether the request is an advertisement.
